## Module 1: Critical Thinking

### Console Application and Syntax Corrections

Demonstrate an understanding of basic C++ programming concepts by completing the following:

1. Create a [simple C++ console application](./src/CSC450_CT1/CSC450_CT1_person.cpp) using Eclipse IDE that prints the following information for a fictional person:

   1. First Name,
   2. Last Name,
   3. Street Address
   4. City
   5. Zip code

2. Given the following code, [correct all syntax errors](./src/CSC450_CT1/CSC450_CT1_mod1_1.cpp) so that the code will compile correctly.

```c++
/* Simple Program with a few Errors for Correction
   Please be sure to correct all outlined errors.
   
   
#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>
   
Standard namespace declaration
using namespace std;
   
Main Function
int main()
{
   
     //Standard Ouput Statement
     cout<<"Welcome to this C++ Program"<<endl;
   
     cout<<I have corrected all errors for this program. <<endl;
   
     // Wait For Output Screen
   
     //Main Function return Statement
   
}
```

3. Given the following code, [correct all syntax errors](./src/CSC450_CT1/CSC450_CT1_mod1_2.cpp) so that the code will compile correctly.

```c++


#include<iostream>
#include<conio.h>

Standard namespace declaration
using namespace std;

Main Function
int main()
{

     double myMoney = 1000.50;  //this should be printed out


     Standard Ouput Statement
     cout"Please be sure to correct all syntax errors in this program"<<endl;

     cout<<"I have corrected all errors for this program. <<endl;

     cout<<" The total amount of money available is = "<<   <<endl;

     // Wait For Output Screen

     Main Function return Statement
     return 0;
}

```

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and [screenshots](./img/) of  the application executing the application, the results and your GIT  repository in a single document.

Module 1 Introduction

In this first module the focus is on introducing you to the C++  programming language since CSU Global programming courses before this  one have focused on Java.

The Module 1 Interactive Lecture covers the basic structure of a C++ program and C++ data types.

It is recommended that you use the Eclipse IDE for your C++  programming assignments in this class, although you can use any C++ IDE  you feel comfortable with (e.g. Visual Studio 2022 or Visual Studio  Code). It is NOT required that you use Eclipse for your C++ programming  assignments.

For the Module 1 Critical Thinking assignment you are to develop a  simple C++ console program that outputs data for a person, and also  correct C++ syntax errors in 2 provided C++ programs.

**To be eligible to receive full credit for your submission you must follow these submission requirements.**

**1) Put each of your 3 C++ source files into a separate .cpp file. Note that I execute all your programs to check them out.**

**2) In a Word or PDF  "Documentation" file, labeled as such, put a copy of your C++ source  code and execution output screen snapshots for each of the 3 programs.**

**3) Include a screenshot showing that you've stored your C++ source code in a GitHub repository.**

**4) Put all files into a single  .zip file, and submit ONLY this .zip file as the only file for your  solution. Do not submit separate Word, PDF, or .cpp files.** 

Personally I have found it better to install separate copies of  Eclipse for Java and C++ but you might have success using both on the  same copy. Some resources that have helped in the past are covered  below.

Here's a great step-by-step video showing how to install Eclipse for  C++ along with the other necessary software and then create a project,  build it, and execute a program -> [Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers - Download, Install, and Run  | clauacademy.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dceXWafU1Z4)

Here's another great video showing how to install Eclipse for C++ on Windows 10 ->[How To Install Eclipse C/C++ IDE Neon on Windows 10/8.1/7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ln1l8qSOBW0)

Here's some more details on configuring Eclipse to develop C++ applications -> [Getting Started with C++ for Eclipse](https://www.codeguru.com/cpp/cpp/getting-started-with-c-for-eclipse.html)

I've also attached a file of screenshots showing my installation of Eclipse for C++.

If you want to install Java and C++ on the same copy of Eclipse following these 2 steps might help:

Step 1) Link to Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - [Eclipse IDE for Java Developers | Eclipse Packages](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/2023-12/r/eclipse-ide-java-developers)

Step 2) YouTube Video for C/C++ - [Eclipse C/C++ Installation Video](https://youtu.be/zd0rsXe-WJg?si=JiNrCrKD930L5Pg8)
