## Module 2: Critical Thinking

### String Input Console Application

Demonstrate an understanding of basic C++ programming concepts by completing the following:

- Program: Create a simple C++ console application that will write a program that will take two string inputs from a user. Your program should concatenate the two strings and then print the resulting output to the screen. Take the two string inputs from the user 3 times for varying string lengths.

Compile and submit your pseudocode, source code, and screenshots of the application executing the application, the results and your GIT repository in a single document.

Module 2 Introduction

In this module we're taking a detailed look at the format of C++ C-strings, possible problems and security vulnerabilities that exist with their use, and suggested mitigation strategies.

In our Module 2 discussion forum you are to explain possible security flaws with C-strings and the built-in C++ functions used to manipulate them. You are to suggest how these problems might be resolved or minimized, and provide appropriate C++ source code to illustrate your points.

For your Module 2 Critical Thinking assignment you are to write a C++ program that inputs 2 strings from the user, concatenates them, displays them, and uses 3 sets of input test data with strings of various lengths.

**To receive full credit for the packaging requirements for your Critical Thinking and Portfolio assignments you must:**

**1) Put your C++ source code in .cpp text files. Note that I execute all your programs to check them out.**

**2) In a Word or PDF "documentation" file, labeled as such,** **put a copy of your C++ source code and execution output screen snapshots.**

**3) Include a screenshot showing that you've stored your C++ source code in a GitHub repository.**

**4) Put all your files into a single** **.zip file, and submit ONLY that .zip file for grading.**
