## Module 3: Critical Thinking

### Integer Pointers Program

Demonstrate an understanding of basic C++ programming concepts by completing the following:

- Program: [Create a C++ program](./CSC450_CT3_integer_pointers.cpp) that asks the user to enter three integer values as input. Store the values into three different variables. For each variable, create an integer pointer to dynamic memory. Display the contents of the variables and pointers. In your program, be sure to use the new operator and delete operators to management memory.

Compile and submit your pseudocode, [source code](CSC450_CT3_integer_pointers.cpp), and [screenshots](./img/CSC450_CT3_integer_pointers.png) of the application executing the application, the results and your GIT repository in a single document.

Module 3 Introduction

In this module we're learning about C++ pointers, which are specially declared variables that point to the address of another variable.

We're seeing how pointers are declared and initialized.

We're learning how the * symbol can be used to declare a pointer, the & symbol can be used to provide the address of a variable to a pointer variable, and how the * symbol can also be used to dereference a pointer to determine the value that's being held by the variable the pointer is pointing to.

We're also discussion the advantages of pointers when working arrays due to the ability to easily perform pointer arithmetic.

The Module 3 Interactive Lecture discusses C++ pointers in detail along with potential security vulnerabilities.

For the Module 3 CT assignment you are to develop a C++ program that allocates dynamic memory for 3 integers via the new operator, gets values for the integers from the user, displays the values of the integers and integer pointers, and then deallocates the dynamic memory via the delete operator.

**To receive full credit for the packaging requirements for your Critical Thinking and Portfolio assignments you must submit the following items and only these items:**

**1) Your [C++ source code](./CSC450_CT3_integer_pointers.cpp) in .cpp text files. Note that I execute all your programs to check them out**

**2) A Word or PDF "documentation" file, labeled as such,** **put a copy of your C++ source code and execution output screen snapshots**

**3) A screenshot showing that you've stored your C++ source code in a GitHub repository (can be combined with #2)**

**4) All your files into a single** **.zip file, and submit ONLY the .zip file for grading**
